I will fix the backend crash and the Google Drive upload issue.

1.  **Install Dependencies**: I will run `npm install` in the `whatsapp-backend` directory to ensure all required packages (like `express`, `dotenv`, etc.) are installed and up to date. This is a common cause for immediate crashes.
2.  **Start Backend & Debug**: I will attempt to start the backend server to see if it runs or captures any specific error messages (like missing environment variables or port conflicts).
3.  **Verify Fix**: Once the backend is running, I will confirm it is listening on port 3004 and ready to handle the `upload-to-drive` request.
